## Case study 
Ticked Off Vet Clinic Vet Clinic software (this is the case study for your final project. You will be coding a solution to this project for Data Driven Applications and Test Applications). (This case study was used for the Worldskills regional competition in 2014.) 

## Background 
Ticked Off Vet Clinic is a long-established vet practice that has been operating in Northern Sydney for many years. The owner, Victor Grahams, has recently retired and has handed the practice over to his son-in-law, Keith Cabrade. Keith sees an urgent need to overhaul the paper-based record keeping procedures and streamline the methods of communicating with clients. 

## Requirements 
Hawkwood Consultants has been employed to provide the new solution for Ticked Off. You have been contracted by Hawkwood Consultants to assist with the development of this solution. You should ensure that you adhere to clean, professional development practices (other developers will love you in the future!). 

## Project Deliverables 
You will be developing a holistic system to help a vet practice manage their data. Specifically you will be asked to: 
* modify and use a database that will assist with record keeping. This database includes details of clients, pets and staff 
* construct user-friendly methods by which all records in the database can be added, edited, displayed and deleted
* provide a way in which pet boarding costs can be calculated
* give users easy access to statistics about pet boarding details 
* export data to CSV format
