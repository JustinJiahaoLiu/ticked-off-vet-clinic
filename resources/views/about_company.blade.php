		<h1>About This Company</h1>

    <h5>Ticked Off is a long-established vet practice that has been operating in the Hornsby area of Sydney for many years. Keith Cabrade, son-in-law of long-term businessman Victor Grahams, owns the magical practice.</h5>


    <h5>Ticked Off has recently received a series of accolades from the industry for their ingenious invention of the easy-tick-disposal product, the Pop Bag. This incredibly clever invention has catapulted Ticked Off to veterinary fame in a way that no bag has done before!</h5>

    <h5>Ticked Off is 100% committed to good service, so hopefully you won't be ticked off... get it?! LOLs. Just a little taste of our witty, vet-flavoured humour.</h5>
